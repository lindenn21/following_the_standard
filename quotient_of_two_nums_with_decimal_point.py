# Ask the user to input 2 numbers
# Divide the 2 numbers
# Print the quotient with decimal point

# Ask the user to input 2 numbers
num1 = float(input("Input first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Input second number: "))

# Divide then prints the answer
quotient = num1 / num2
print(f"The quotient is ({quotient})")

# Prog05: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the quotient of the two numbers with the decimal point
